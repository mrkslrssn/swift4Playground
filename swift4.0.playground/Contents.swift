/*
 Swift 4 source compatibility, mostly Swift 3 compatible mostly refinements and SDK improvements.
 Additive features that extends the existing syntax.

 Swift 3.2 is a compilation mode of the Swift 4 compiler (not a separate toolchain)
 It emulates Swift 3 for the Swift 4 compiler for a smoother migration. This makes Swift 3 projects build and run without issues on the Swift 4 compiler.

 Swift 3.2 and Swift 4 can co-exists in the same application, the language is set on target level. So app target can be migrated without the need for migrate all dependecies and frameworks in order and at the same time.
 */

/*
 Swift Package Manager improvements for server-side Swift
 */

/*
 New Build System written in Swift on top off the open-source LLBuild engine that promise to be faster, lower overhead for large projects especially for incremental builds. Improved Indexing, now part of the build step and not running in the background. This is available as an technology preview in the Project Settings of Xcode 9.

 Xcode 9 also introduces precompiled bridging headers to speed up compile time for large projects with mixed source files.

 Code size improvements with minimal inference, Swift 4 compiler will automatically optimise away conformances that are unused. For example if the comparable Date struct extension is not used.

 Another improvement is the symbol tables size, Swift 3 uses a lot of symbols with long names, of the standard library in Swift 3 almost half the size was taken up by symbols. In Swift 4 this has been reduced a lot even though there is more content the overall size has decresed. The symbol table size has be reduced to ~one-fifh. Build setting

class SomeNSObjectClass: NSObject {

In Swift 4 @objc is only inferred when its absolutly needed such as overriding Objective-C method or conforming to Objective-C protocol
